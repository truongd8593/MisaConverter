# MisaConverter

# Available converters:

- PS to PDF converter: contains a Java method calling ghost4j API to convert a .ps file to .pdf file. Scientific documents in the early 90s were .ps files. Before coding this tool, I usually rely on an online ps to pdf converter, which is in fact, can lead to security vunerables.

- MOV to MP4 converter: calling jave 1.0.2 API to convert MOV to mp4 files. This is useful when I upload my old videos in my PC to Tiktok.
